# Supersonic_nozzle

#### This script provides the ideal nozzle geometry using the method of
#### characteristics for an almost 2D diverging nozzle. Suppose gas is
#### exhaust from a combustion chamber with no mass flow, and temperature and pressure are known.
#### Using the 2D nozzle flow relationships, an optimal throat area is found
#### that will produce the maximum amount of thrust for the given ambient pressure
#### and parameters of the combustion chamber.
